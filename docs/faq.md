## What are the Proposal Templates for? 
To help guide the user through common proposal types. These templates include proposals to change voting parameters, send tokens from the DAO, and add & revoke permissions. A general template allows members to create custom proposals for anything outside the three templates described above.

## What are the key permissions and what do they do?
Key permissions enable the assignment of various role and responsibilities to specific DAO members, a feature made possible by the innovative standards LUKSO has created.

|Vote | Allows a member to vote on proposals on the DAO profile page     |
|Propose | Allows a member to make proposals on the DAO profile page and in the governance tab       |

## What are my options for voting parameters?

**Participation rate** - the minimum percentage of the total DAO members needed to vote on a proposal for it to be executed.

**Majority** - the minimum percentage of votes needed on a proposal option to execute the result (i.e., if there is a 66% majority and the votes come in at 51% yes, the proposal is not passed).

**Voting Delay** - the period in which a proposal is open for viewing but unable to be voted on. This gives a chance for the community to research the topic and have a discussion before voting.

**Voting Period** - the period a proposal is open for voting.

**Execution Delay** - the period after voting has ended and between when the result is executed.
