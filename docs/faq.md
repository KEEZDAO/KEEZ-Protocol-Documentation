# FAQ

## What are the Proposal Templates for? 
To help guide the user through common proposal types. These templates include proposals to change voting parameters, send tokens from the DAO, and add & revoke permissions. A general template allows members to create custom proposals for anything outside the three templates described above.

## What are the key permissions and what do they do?
Key permissions enable the assignment of various role and responsibilities to specific DAO members, a feature made possible by the innovative standards LUKSO has created.
