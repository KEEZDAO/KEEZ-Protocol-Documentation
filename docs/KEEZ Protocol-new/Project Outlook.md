## Project Outlook

In this short amount of time we have created an MVP for DAO governance on LUKSO, but we intend to continue development and make improvements in the following areas:

### Usability

* Addition of delegate execution 
  * We give out permissions for delegation, yet there is no way for it to happen.

* Adding and removing members to the multisig
  * The multisig is created when the DAO creation process happens, but after that, there is no way to add/remove members to the multisig.
  * There is also no way to manage the permissions of the multisig.

* Adding the ability to create new vaults 
  * You can create one vault during the DAO creation process, but there is no way to make another or manage the permissions of the initial one.

* Custom voting options
  * Right now, we only offer approve, reject, and abstain for voting choices; there is no way to customize them.

* The ability for members with Add/Revoke permissions to add or remove without a proposal
  * Permissions have been created to allow individual DAO members to add/revoke the permissions of others, yet there is no UI for them to do so.
 
* The ability for members to view current permissions 
  * The DAO gives out permissions during the creation process, and there isn't an easy way to view which permissions an individual has received. 

### Manually assigning permissions 
* For now, all members to whom a DAO wishes to give permissions must be manually added in the DAO creation process or through a proposal. 
* This is highly inefficient. There must be a way to "mass add" members to basic permissions levels—some distribution model to onboard communities. We have several ideas for solving this issue. One would be an "HR" team. A team for the DAO that is in charge of onboarding, educating, and adequately allocating DAO members to their respective departments. This team would still have to add each member's permissions one by one potentially, but at least they are going through an onboarding process. 
* Another solution might be a distribution model like token distribution. Attaching key permissions to a token so that when people hold it, their wallet automatically enters the Key Manager logic, and they can execute whatever permissions correlate to the token. 
* There is also currently no way for a non-member to join a DAO. There must be applications to join, socials linked for inquiries, etc. There are proposal templates in place for adding member permissions, but some way for people to join when they want would be ideal.

### Governance 
* Our governance process has been made to avoid financially gated voting and improper weighing scales. We have implemented one-to-one voting with delegation. Similar to the proposals and permissions, we hope to create the option for more voting schemes to be added down the line. We want DAOs to have a choice in how their community votes, but we at KEEZ prefer the most democratic and fair option, which is currently one-to-one with delegation.
* KEEZ Protocol will aim to create departmentalized DAOs with specific pockets of people trained to accomplish certain tasks with their particular governance process attached. For example, the devs have a department of all devs. Any developer-related proposal is proposed to that group and voted on by that group. Ideally, this group can create its voting parameters and weight system. This creates a situation where only people who are educated and relevant to the proposal are the ones voting on it. This can lead to increased participation rates on proposals and effectiveness of decision-making. 

### Organizational Structure 
* Our MVP has demonstrated how key permissions can be used to segment positions and roles within a DAO. Individuals can earn certain permissions to perform specific tasks, and using the smart contract-based nature of the Universal Profiles; we can continue adding permissions and segmenting roles. Research is needed on properly and effectively departmentalizing workers in a DAO. 
* The individual structure of a DAO will be determined by its needs and goals, but enabling them the tools to do so is where we come in. With the help of identity systems, these DAOs could identify an individual member's strengths and segment them wherever needed to best accomplish their task. From there, permissions allow that subgroup of like-minded workers to propose, vote, and work within a specific group to achieve those tasks. This will lead to improved voting structures, more accurate and accountable decisions, and a level of efficiency that DAOs have never experienced. 
* Again, significant research is required around the best course of action to enable this. However, we deem this an essential addition moving forward. With proper organization, we can knock off several issues around DAOs, including disorganization of operation, financially gated access, inadequate compensations, and flawed governance systems–that is quite the claim. These issues are not present in most successful web2 organizations, which can be attributed to their ability to coordinate humans more effectively than DAOs. 

### Identity 
* An identity system will be needed moving forward. At KEEZ protocol, researching identity solutions and how they can assist us in our key permission distribution, organization, and improvement of the overall DAO experience is the highest priority. Implementing an identity system that allows us to correctly identify the strengths and knowledge of workers, fill them into their roles, and compensate them accordingly will move us towards our goal of creating the organizations of the future. It will create a higher functioning organization and benefit the DAO members, as they will begin building reputation and recognition for their skills and achievements. 
* Our identity system needs to be flexible enough to accept identity systems from outside our ecosystem and also address common issues like revocability, proper storage, and account recovery. Thankfully, we are building with the LUKSO suite of standards that intrinsically enables flexibility and solutions to problems around identity. Further researching how we can use LUKSOs standards to create an identity system will be useful in our DAO stack. 
	
Building has been a fun experience for this KEEZ team, and the research that has been done to bring forth this project has led us down many paths. We have much work ahead of us if we want to enable DAOs to be the organizations of the future. Identity/reputation systems are on the cutting edge of this already sharp industry, and we look forward to continuing our research into how they can help DAOs. Thanks to LUKSOs suite of standards, these possibilities are becoming more and more of a reality.
