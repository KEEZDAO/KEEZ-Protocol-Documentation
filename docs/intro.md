# KEEZ Protocol

KEEZ Protocol, powered by KEEZ DAO, allows individuals to create a DAO using a Universal Profile (UP). Through the smart contract based tools provided by LUKSO, we are able to entirely reinvent how DAOs onboard members, participate in governance, and manage their operation. Our mission is to create DAOs built on UPs that are viable as organizations of the future.

## Project Explanation

The KEEZ protocol platform allows individuals to create a DAO and distribute permissions to members. The permissions can enable members to vote, propose, delegate, add/revoke permissions, and access the vaults and multisig of the DAO. The goal is to revolutionize DAO governance models and step away from financially gated access.
