The status of a proposal can be one of three possibilities:

- **Active** (green) - members can select an option and vote. 
- **Pending** (yellow) - members cannot vote but can view the proposal details. 
- **Closed** (red) - members cannot vote but can view the results, and members with execute and register permissions can finish the proposal.
