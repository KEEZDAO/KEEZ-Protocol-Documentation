Next, you will decide your DAOs default voting parameters. These parameters include

- **Participation rate** - the minimum percentage of the total DAO members needed to vote on a proposal for it to be executed.
- **Majority** - the minimum percentage of votes needed on a proposal option to execute the result (i.e., if there is a 66% majority and the votes come in at 51% yes, the proposal is not passed).
- **Voting Delay** - the period in which a proposal is open for viewing but unable to be voted on. This gives a chance for the community to research the topic and have a discussion before voting.
- **Voting Period** - the period a proposal is open for voting.
- **Execution Delay** - the period after voting has ended and between when the result is executed.
