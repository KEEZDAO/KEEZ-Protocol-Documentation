The next step is to create a vault for the DAO. A vault is a storage location for various assets and data. It is controlled by multiple Universal Profiles through a multisig.

Here you will 
* Enter a vault name (e.g., Main Vault, Dev Vault, etc.), 
* Add members to the multisig for the UP
* Input the percentage of multisig members needed to sign a transaction. 

Click **Next** when you are satisfied with multisig members.

### Step 4 - Create Your Default Voting Parameters
![2E](./img/step-02-create-dao/Create-A-DAO-Page-04.PNG)

Next, you will decide your DAOs default voting parameters. These parameters include

- **Participation rate** - the minimum percentage of the total DAO members needed to vote on a proposal for it to be executed.
- **Majority** - the minimum percentage of votes needed on a proposal option to execute the result (i.e., if there is a 66% majority and the votes come in at 51% yes, the proposal is not passed).
- **Voting Delay** - the period in which a proposal is open for viewing but unable to be voted on. This gives a chance for the community to research the topic and have a discussion before voting.
- **Voting Period** - the period a proposal is open for voting.
- **Execution Delay** - the period after voting has ended and between when the result is executed.
