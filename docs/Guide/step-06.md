The user profile page pulls information from your Universal Profile. 

Here you can see the current DAOs you are a member of and use filters (similar to those on the Discover Page) to find the DAO in which youâ€™d like to participate.

Individual activity is viewable in the activity tab of the sidebar. 

## User Activity

![6-2](./img/6-2_user_activity.png)
