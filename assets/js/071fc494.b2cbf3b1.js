Building with LUSKO standards, interacting with the LUKSO team and community, and creating a dApp has strengthened us. At this time, our team has produced a site that allows a blockchain-based identity to create a DAO using LSP0, the Universal Profile (UP). With the UP, the DAO can onboard members through the LSP6 (key manager), create a vault (LSP9) for data and asset management, and govern the DAO. These ideas can be further developed to make a full DAO stack run through a single UP. For now, our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows for essential DAO functions.
